# Zie619 Community Workflows

This folder serves as a placeholder for Zie619's community-sourced n8n workflows. Zie619 has created an excellent browsable interface for exploring and managing n8n workflows already so I did not have to create one.

Once you are done with setup (works on Python v3.8.18), the portal will be able to open Zie619's template browser because you would have setup reverse proxy to where this placeholder path would be.

## Setup Instructions

To set up Zie619's workflow browser locally:

1. **Download the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/Zie619/n8n-workflows
cd n8n-workflows
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the application**
```
python run.py
```

4. **Test locally**
Open in browser
http://localhost:8000

5. **Configure reverse proxy**
   Configure your reverse proxy to point to the running Python application. Then the portal will be able to open this curated collection as well.

## Workflow Categorization

Weng built a dropdown filter that lets you browse 2,000+ workflows by category.

Until author Zie619 merges the categorization feature (üôè), you can access it on my fork:
üëâ https://github.com/Siphon880gh/n8n-workflows-contributing

The system includes an automated categorization feature that organizes workflows by service categories to make them easier to discover and filter.

### How Categorization Works

1. **Run the categorization script**
   ```
   python create_categories.py
   ```

2. **Service Name Recognition**
   The script analyzes each workflow JSON filename to identify recognized service names (e.g., "Twilio", "Slack", "Gmail", etc.)

3. **Category Mapping**
   Each recognized service name is matched to its corresponding category using the definitions in `context/def_categories.json`. For example:
   - Twilio ‚Üí Communication & Messaging
   - Gmail ‚Üí Communication & Messaging  
   - Airtable ‚Üí Data Processing & Analysis
   - Salesforce ‚Üí CRM & Sales

4. **Search Categories Generation**
   The script produces a `search_categories.json` file that contains the categorized workflow data

5. **Filter Interface**
   Users can then filter workflows by category in the search interface, making it easier to find workflows for specific use cases

### Available Categories

The categorization system includes the following main categories:
- AI Agent Development
- Business Process Automation
- Cloud Storage & File Management
- Communication & Messaging
- Creative Content & Video Automation
- Creative Design Automation
- CRM & Sales
- Data Processing & Analysis
- E-commerce & Retail
- Financial & Accounting
- Marketing & Advertising Automation
- Project Management
- Social Media Management
- Technical Infrastructure & DevOps
- Web Scraping & Data Extraction

### Contribute Categories

You can help expand the categorization by adding more service-to-category mappings (e.g., Twilio ‚Üí Communication & Messaging) in context/defs_categories.json.

Many workflow JSON files are conveniently named with the service name, often separated by underscores (_).
